                            This is one of my school projects I was making for desktop aplication lessons
                            
                                                  if you are working at the same project
                                                            DO NOT COPY CODE

                                                You can try the same type of construction
                                                        BUT DO NOT COPY THIS CODE



                                                               !WARNING!
